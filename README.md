## E-Commerce Customer Segmentation

### Project Overview

## Customer Segmentation (with PCA) 

### Project Overview
* In this project we will start using PCA for dimensionality reduction and then perform customer segmentation with K-means clustering algorithms.  
* Our goal is to reduce the original 29-features dataframe to an only 3 components dataframe via pca, find the clusters within them, and visualize in a 3D plot.
